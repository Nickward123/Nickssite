<h2 Style="color:white">Underwater Mcdonald's Dream </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom:100px"> This was quite an interesting dream. Although its
    rather short, it was
    funny
    enough to record. To set
    the scene, I found myself eating with some friends in a Mcdonald’s that was halfway underwater in the middle of the
    ocean. Although there was no water flooding inside, I could see the water level reaching about halfway up the door
    outside the restaurant. On the outside the area was beautiful. The restaurant was surrounded by a light blue/ teal
    water
    you would see on remote islands with shallow waters. In the distance, I could see a nearby Island maybe about a mile
    off
    the coast. Somehow this must have been a feature of a resort that I had been visiting, although I had no
    recollection of
    how I actually got there. However, the inside of the restaurant was a different story. There were puddles of water
    on
    the ground everywhere and multiple wet floor signs out. The staff seemed ghetto and I was afraid of the food
    quality. I
    remember there was a Mexican worker going around with a trashcan asking people if they had any trash they needed
    thrown
    away. I told her that I had some and she looked right above me and completely ignored me and kept moving. I remember
    thinking that it was the most ghetto Mcdonald’s I had ever been too. Yet it was surrounded by such a nice area. All
    of a
    sudden the black woman manager started running toward a window on the floor beside a table. There were three black
    women
    trying to swim up to the window and break in to rob it or something. She went outside through the window and began
    to
    fight them underwater and ward them off, it seemed like nothing out of the ordinary here. They were all swimming
    around
    fighting when someone told me to go lock the door quickly. I got up and noticed one of the women was breaking in the
    front. I tried to lock the door but I realized that the door had already been locked, and I had unlocked it by
    accident.
    She started pushing the door in water began to pour in the restaurant. I used all my might and I was barely able to
    close it. That’s where the dream began to fade.

    The significance? Although it was a dream, I can say I am probably one of the only people in history, if not only
    person, to experience what it would be like to eat at Mcdonald’s in the middle of the ocean halfway under water.
