<h2 Style="color:white">On the run for murder </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 200px;">I dreampt that I was at a college party having a great
    time. All of my friends were there and we were having drinks.
    Everybody was amped up. The weird thing about this party was that it was located in a parking garage. It may have
    been
    some kind of tailgate, hard to say for sure. Either way we were having a great time when all of a sudden a truck
    rolled
    in doing donuts. I decided to get in the back of the truck and shotgun a beer as it drove around and burned its
    rubber.
    People were cheering me on and it was a great time. All of a sudden, this truck crashed into a car that was parked
    in
    the parking lot. It kept going, crashing into one car after another. I was laughing very hard at this point, it was
    so
    funny to me that this guy was crashing into cars and driving away. The car then began to leave the party and drive
    away
    so I hopped out to rejoin my friends. That’s when I saw the horror in front of me. The truck had not only been
    crashing
    into cars, but it ran over many people without me realizing it. There were mutilated bodies scattered everywhere.
    <br>
    Suddenly an extra level of horror hit me. I realized that with all of these dead people, I could be held
    responsible.
    Everyone saw me in the back of the truck, laughing, as it ran these people over. If it was caught on security
    camera, I
    could be done for. I found my friend Colson and told him my plan. My idea was that if I called the cops now, and
    told
    them the story then I might be ok. I would explain how I didn’t know he was hitting people and that I was not in on
    this
    at all. My second option would be to leave right now and pretend I was never there. If the garage didn’t have
    security
    cameras I could possibly get away. However if I got caught after trying to flee, things would look 10x worse for me.
    I
    told Colson I was going to call the cops and tell them my story, but he disagreed. He just looked at me and said
    “run”.
    This made the situation even more intense because before, I thought calling the cops was the obvious option, but
    now,
    Colson made me hesitate. I stood there contemplating what my next move was going to be, knowing that a wrong
    decision
    could send me to prison for life.
    <br>
    Luckily, I woke up soon after. This may have been the most relieved I’d ever been to discover something was a dream.
