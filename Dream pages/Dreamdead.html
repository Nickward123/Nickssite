<h2 Style="color:white">The time I died </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 200px;"> During my freshman year of college, I experienced
    what I believe to be the closest simulation to death without dying. I
    dreamt that I was in some sort of space craft orbiting the earth. The craft was small, maybe about the size of a
    small
    car, and it was cone shaped. This craft was meant to deploy a parachute and get me to earth, but something had gone
    horribly wrong. The parachute messed up and the craft began to hurl towards earth at immense speeds. I could see
    fire
    start to cover up the windows at all sides. I launched so fast downward that I felt my heart stop. I could see the
    ship
    around me start to fade, and I realized due to the rate of acceleration, I would die before I reached earth’s lower
    atmosphere. In this moment I died. It was a very strange feeling. My final thought before dying was “I died”. That
    it. A
    few seconds before, my body had been filled with fear and adrenaline, but all of a sudden, all my feelings were
    completely gone. No more emotion. No more fear. Just complete acceptance. I had died and there was no other option I
    had. My brain ceased thought and emotion entirely, and I experience blackness with the last thought echoing through
    whatever part of me that was left “I died”. After about 3 seconds, I began to regain feeling in my body and woke up
    in
    my bed. It was like my body was ready to shut down, then realized that I was actually still completely alive. It was
    a
    powerful feeling, but when I woke I was just happy to be alive.
