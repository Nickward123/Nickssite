<h2 Style="color:white">Fishing with Yoshi </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 200px;"> One time, I dreamt I was in a small canoe off the
    coast of some cliffs
    coming out of the water. In the canoe with me was
    my brother Jake, his friend Ian, and none other than Yoshi, the dinosaur from Mario. The scene of Yoshi in the boat
    with
    us was completely normal, and I did not even begin to question the fact that I was hanging out with a video game
    character. This is not the only time I have had dreams like this. Anyways, we were out here in the ocean fishing,
    but
    not just doing any normal fishing. Ian had brought us here to show us how to catch a certain type of fish. I don’t
    know
    what you would call it, but it was a green worm like fish that looked like a popular cat toy. The image below is
    exactly
    what it looked like. You couldn’t catch these fish with a hook and line, but you had to swim underwater and catch
    them
    by hand. First you had to go under water, and squeeze a liquid out of them by pinching their body from the bottom
    and
    pulling upward like a gogurt. Once you got the liquid out, you’d eat the fish raw underwater. Ian was the main one
    doing
    this, jake was following him, while Yoshi and I were pretty hesitant. I remember swimming under and removing the
    liquid
    but not being sure if I should actually do it. I think Yoshi was the most scared out of all of us and I don’t
    remember
    actually ever eating the fish.
    This dream happened sometime in 2021
