<h2 Style="color:white">Pulled out of dream </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 200px;">This dream occurred during my sophomore year of
    college, a time where lucid dreaming was a regular occurrence for me.
    The dream begun on a street where my family lived for a short while. I was sitting in the driveway on the lawn chair
    with some friends from high school beside me. I can’t remember who it was, but someone was walking their dog and I
    didn’t feel like saying hi to them so I decided to make myself become invisible. All of a sudden I realized this was
    a
    dream since I could never make myself go invisible in real life. My first thought was “wow, I didn’t know you could
    even
    do this in dreams”. I decided to just keep sitting on the lawn chair to observe. I wanted to see what the dream
    world
    looked like. I was astounded at the immense detail. I could see every leaf on the trees across the street. I could
    see
    clouds in the sky. I could feel the breeze on my skin. It looked nearly indistinguishable from real life. I got
    kinda
    freaked out at this point, as I felt too aware. The difference between this and real life was that in a dream, logic
    doesn’t apply. Anything could happen to me at any moment without any real reason. I got up and got the urge to start
    warning others that this was just a dream. I saw a guy I knew from college who was a few years older than me. I said
    “Hey man! This is all just a dream!” He looked at me and laughed a little, he was confused but seemed to kinda
    believe
    me. “What??” he said while laughing. Telling him it was a dream seemed to really confuse him, as if he realized how
    much
    sense that actually made. I went around telling more and more people that this was all a dream. Somehow there were
    now
    lots of people on the street I was on, so I climbed on top of a wall to address them all. I said “Everyone! This is
    just
    a dream! None of this is real!” Peoples attention turned to me, as I continued to shout at the crowd letting them
    know
    that none of this was real. As I tried to keep talking, I felt an invisible, giant hand grab my entire body and pull
    me
    upwards rapidly, ripping me out of the dream. I immediately woke in my bed.
    I wondered that morning, why did it need to take me out of the dream? Was I alerting too many dream people?
