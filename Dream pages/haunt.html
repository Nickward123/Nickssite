<h2 Style="color:white">Haunted room </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8;;"> This is one of the strangest and most powerful dreams I have ever had to
    this day. This happened during my freshman year
    of college, a period of many strange dreams. This dream creates many false memories that overlap with real life
    memories, I will try to differentiate between the two as best I can.
    <br>
    To start, there was a false memory about my life that was the main focus of this dream. Essentially, I had believed
    my
    room was haunted for years and nobody would believe me. I had experienced many scary things (in fake dream memories)
    and
    tried to share with others what I had seen, but nobody seemed to care. One day me and my Dad were in my room,
    although
    he rarely goes up there, and all of a sudden the door slammed with extreme force completely on its own. It made a
    loud
    noise and I immediately looked over to my Dad with an expression of “You saw that right?” For the first ever time my
    Dad
    seemed to believe me. We talked for a second and he said something along the lines of “Yeah, that was really weird”.
    He
    seemed a bit scared, but not overly frightened. I left my room out of fear.
    <br>
    Hours pass and I needed to grab something from my room. I go back in and for some reason I yell loud as to “scare
    the
    ghost” as I walk into the room. I also did this to make myself laugh and be less scared. After yelling I hear my mom
    angrily call my name downstairs. I realize it was late at night now, and my little brothers were sleeping so she was
    mad
    at me for being so loud. I went downstairs and I said “Ok mom I’m sorry but this time you have to believe me, its
    haunted. Ask Dad he saw the whole thing!” My mom sort of cut me off near the end and said: “Nick… we know”. Confused
    I
    said “What do you mean?” My mom began to tell me a story.
    <br>
    When I was younger we occasionally had someone clean our house. In my dream, this person had occasionally brought
    her
    friend from South America to stay in our house at times when I was young. This part of the memory was completely
    fake,
    however the cleaner was a real person. My mom asked me if I remembered when her friend would come and stay the
    night. I
    remembered, but I was very young and must’ve been about 5 the last time I saw her. My mom described the woman as
    very
    odd, and I remember her using the word “vague” which is a funny way to describe a person. Images flashed in my head
    remembering what she looked like. I remembered that she wore only black all the time, and she had an almost witch
    like
    appearance. She spoke very little and gave off a strange vibe overall according to my mom. My mom reminded me that
    because we didn’t have enough space in our house that I often had to sacrifice my room to let her stay. I began to
    remember this as she told me. I was confused at this point. I remembered all of these things, but was not sure why
    she
    was telling me them until my mom said something that gave me chills that I don’t think could even be matched in real
    life. “She died in your room mysteriously one night” my mom said. She said that one day out of the blue, in her 50s
    she
    died there without explanation and ever since then I had been talking about hauntings in my room.
    It may not sound significant, but I cannot begin to describe the emotion I felt in that moment. It was a feeling of
    relief, so enhanced it felt more intense than the emotions I feel in real life. After all these years… I wasn’t
    crazy! I
    had spent so long battling this, thinking I was insane, and just like that, it felt like a world of weight had been
    lifted off my shoulders. Finally, I could live peacefully knowing that what I felt was real.
    My mom went on to say that they didn’t want to believe it was true for years, but now there was just no denying it.
    We
    had only moved into that house a few years before that happened, and they were hoping they did not have to move yet.
    She
    then asked if I wanted a priest to come to the house to remove the spirit which I replied yes.
    <br>
    I am not sure what to make of this dream or its meaning. Although it wasn’t action packed, it had more detail than
    any
    dream I can remember. I remember waking up in a cold sweat after this dream and I could only think “why in the world
    would I ever dream something like that” I am not sure what the overall significance was, and I still get chills
    thinking
    about it. My only thought is that my dream was telling me something like “You’re not crazy”. I would like a dream
    interpreter for this one one day.
