<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 200px;"> I am going to explain the lucid dream methods that
    work best for me. I will note that it will be significantly more
    difficult for people who have normal sleep schedules.
    <br>
    <br>
    In my opinion the first step to lucid dreaming is simply to be aware and thinking about them. The first time I had
    any
    sort of lucid dream experience was when I was about 12. I had heard of lucid dreaming by this point. Eventually just
    by
    being aware of it, I had a few short-lived lucid dreams. I didn’t do much in these, maybe try to experiment a bit,
    but
    they were very short and random. I did not have these again till much later.
    <br>

    I believe the next thing you need to do is to have vivid dreams. My most vivid dreams occur after being woken up in
    the
    morning, and returning to a deep sleep. One way someone can do this is by setting an alarm early in the morning
    around
    6am, staying up for about 15 minutes and going back to sleep. The truth is that the more time you have to do this,
    the
    more success you will have. My sophomore year of college I had more lucid dreams than ever because of my schedule. I
    had
    one class at 9am, then nothing for a long while. I would wake up around 8:30 – go to class 9:00-9:50. Go home and
    eat
    after class and go back to sleep around 10:30. Often times it took very long to fall asleep since I was awake for so
    long and I would become discouraged. I found that these times where I struggled to fall asleep, would generally turn
    into the strongest of dreams. After a while, I would eventually fall asleep and have very vivid dreams almost every
    time
    and with large amount of them, I would remember everything and become lucid. Much of the time when falling asleep I
    would become excited realizing that it was about to happen, then I would awaken again. These times were frustrating,
    but
    again, when I was able to fall asleep during these moments, I had the most success. As I attempted to fall asleep
    during
    this time, I would only think about lucid dreaming. I would tell myself that as soon as I fall asleep, I will
    control my
    dream.
    <br>
    It has been about 2 years since this peak of lucid dreaming but since I had them so often, I still become lucid
    occasionally without trying. The first lucid dream is the hardest to achieve, but the more you have them, the easier
    the
    next one be.
