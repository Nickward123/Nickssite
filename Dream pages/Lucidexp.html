<h2 Style="color:white">Lucid Dream Experiments </h2>
<hr>
<p Style="color:#81c27a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 200px;"> This page is meant to conglomerate a series of
    experiments I have conducted while lucid dreaming in an attempt to master
    the dream world. I will try to order things as best I can, but there are quite a few different topics I will need to
    touch on. There is a lot of information floating around on the internet regarding lucid dreaming. Many people claim
    they
    have abilities to do certain things in dreams but its hard to prove or disprove. I will be telling my experiences in
    complete truth to clear some myths/ rumors surrounding lucid dreaming knowing I have much to learn as well.
    <br>
    1. <ins>All 5 senses are present while dreaming.</ins>
    <br>
    This may be obvious to some, others might not believe it. The classic trope that you can pinch yourself to see if
    you
    are dreaming is false. You can feel everything including pain. In my experience, although you can feel things, the
    pain
    threshold is much lower. In fact, the sense of feeling seems to be numbed in general, that not to say it isn’t still
    significant. I remember when I was young I dreamt I was being attacked by a dog and remember feeling pain. It wasn’t
    till almost a decade later that I consciously dreamt and felt surfaces around me to prove that. Obviously sight is
    also
    present in dreams, and no, you don’t dream in black and white. Sound is present as well. I remember a specific
    instance
    during a lucid dream, I heard a song so loud and clearly, I convinced myself that I must have fallen asleep with
    headphones on and forgot to turn music off. I heard details that I don’t think I could consciously replicate. There
    was
    no music in real life, however. One of my favorite aspects of lucid dreaming is the sense of taste. I remember one
    dream
    I found some crazy desserts and spent the entirety of my remaining conscious dream devouring. You don’t get full,
    and
    you can eat foods that don’t even exist in real life. There is no limit to how much you can eat. I still try to
    spawn
    certain foods whenever I dream because it is something to do that never fails. However, spawning food isn’t always
    easy.
    I will get into that next.
    <br>
    2. <ins>Powers & abilities in dreams</ins>
    <br>
    I will start with the power of spawning items. Many people online claim they have endless abilities in dreams and
    can do
    absolutely anything. I would say that in my experiences there are some limits as to what you can do and when. The
    amount
    of power you have also relies on how vivid the dream is, but that is something I want to experiment with more in the
    future. Anyways, making an item appear in front of me out of thin air almost never works. Sometimes If I try too
    hard to
    focus to create something, I will get some deformed object temporarily, and I will usually awaken because I focused
    too
    hard (common theme). The method that I have gone with which is pretty much 100% effective is to reach behind
    something
    and blindly feel around expecting to find whatever you want to spawn. For example, I wanted to eat a donut one time
    in
    my dream, so I felt around under my couch telling myself that a donut was under there. Eventually, I felt the donut,
    pulled it out and there it was. I ate it and it tasted good.
    <br>
    Many people are focused on flying in dreams. Flying can be very fun but I still haven’t completely mastered it.
    Sometimes I am able to fly with ease, other times I come back to the ground and don’t have the ability. I am still
    trying to find the reason for this but I have a few ideas and will continue experimenting before putting anything
    here.
    Anyways I will mention that there are times when my dream felt almost too vivid to fly. For example one time I was
    at
    the top of a skyscraper, and I knew I could jump off, fly, and be fine. However the dream just felt too real. I
    could
    feel the wind on me and see cars hundreds of feet below. I decided not to jump.
    <br>
    Another thing in terms of powers is that you are generally the strongest person in the dream when lucid dreaming
    (contrary to some regular dreams). But generally if you punch someone in the face they wont even fight back.
    <br>
    Finally, I want to talk about set & setting. In my experience, you cannot choose the location of your lucid dream. I
    will find myself somewhere and have to stick with it. You can walk around, but you’ll never get anywhere super
    meaningful unless you really try. For example, I used to have dreams of driving on the highway and never reaching my
    destination. Or dreams trying to leave my neighborhood but somehow always ending up back in it. One time while I was
    lucid and I really wanted to go to my house. I was already in my neighborhood but no matter what I couldn’t find it.
    I
    focused really hard while going around a corner and told myself that this would be my street. It worked, I saw my
    house
    and went in it. I saw some family members but they appeared much younger than they are in real life right now.
    Shortly
    after, I woke up, likely from focusing too hard. There was one other particular instance where I found myself in my
    house completely alone at night and all the lights were off (light switches don’t work in dreams I will talk about
    this
    later). It was storming outside and it felt like there was nothing to do. One thing that I like doing while lucid
    dreaming is entering random houses on my street. I like to see how my brain generates places, and often times the
    houses
    are very cool. This time however, every time I left my front door and made it about 5 steps down the walkway, my
    dream
    would start to fade away. As soon as I turned back, The dream would begin to regenerate, making it seem it wanted to
    keep me in the house.
    <br>
    <ins>3.Random observances</ins>
    <br>
    One thing I eventually started doing while I was lucid dreaming consistently was simply sitting back and observing
    things. I’ve taken some cool bits of information out whether they are useful or not. The first thing is that: when
    you
    look at an object, then look away, then look back, the object will change in appearance. You probably wouldn’t
    normally
    ever notice these changes when dreaming subconsciously, you’d have to look close for them. The first time I saw this
    I
    remember there I was looking closely at a large group of seashells in sand. I looked away and looked back, and
    although
    the sea shells were still there, they all looked completely different. Different shapes, sizes, colors and
    arrangements.
    I tried it again and it happened again. My idea is that your brain can only remember so many small details, but
    won’t
    forget that there was an object there. This happened a different time where I was spawning donuts in a drawer. I
    told
    myself, “When I open this drawer, there will be donuts.” It worked, there were three donuts in the drawer, but then
    I
    decided to experiment further by closing the drawer then reopening it. When I opened it again, the donuts looked
    completely different. There were still three donuts, but they had different flavors, colors, sizes, amounts of
    sprinkles
    etc. I did this again and it happened a third time. Again, the idea is that your brain can only process so many
    details
    but it won’t forget that there was an object there. This also happened to me one time when I was looking at the
    palms of
    my hands. I memorized the lines on them to see if they would be the same as the lines on my hands in real life.
    Later in
    the dream I checked again, and the arrangements of lines were different. Neither reflected the real life lines on my
    palms.
    <br>
    I will talk about light switches now. Light switches in dreams have bothered me for years, long before I was a lucid
    dreamer. I used to have dreams about waking up in my room but my lamp didn’t work, I would go to my bathroom and my
    bathroom lights didn’t work either. To this day when I lucid dream, light switches wont work. Lights are often on,
    but
    you can’t change them on or off. I have tried this over and over again and no change. This is weird because my
    brother
    and I have both had instances of door/garage passwords working, yet never the light switches. One dream I opened a
    garage with a password, then went inside and immediately tried the light switches which didn’t work. There are many
    others who have experienced this too. One time I had a conversation with a dream NPC. I was trying to show him that
    we
    were dreaming and I told him to turn the light switch off and it wouldn’t work. To no surprise, he switched the
    lights
    and they remained on.
    <br>
    One last thing I want to note is that there are different levels of lucid dreams. For the sake of simplicity: I will
    categorize them into 3 levels. Level 1 lucid dreams are when I have realized I’m dreaming, but still continue
    throughout
    my nonsensical dream as if it were real. It is like I am barely conscious, or my subconscious mind realized that it
    was
    dreaming. Level 2 lucid dreams happen when I have steady control over my dream, but the dream is not all that vidid.
    Level 3 dreams are the most vivid and realistic, and my guess is that these happen at the peak of rem sleep. This is
    when things appear almost as realistic as real life.
    <br>
    One more thing to note before I conclude is that if you focus too hard at any point during a lucid dream, you could
    awaken. It is pretty difficult to maintain the dream by not thinking too much, but also remaining aware of
    everything.
